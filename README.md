## 🧠 How it works

The bot's operational flow now includes the complete multi-sig cycle.

1.  Signs in using the provided private key(s).
2.  **Creates new multi-sig wallets and deposits KITE into them.**
3.  **Withdraws all available funds from all existing multi-sig wallets back to the main account.**
4.  Unstake/claims staking rewards.
5.  Stakes tokens to available subnets.
6.  Completes the daily quiz.
7.  Sends chat with generated messages to currently available agents.
8.  Executes a cycle of token swaps between KITE and USDT.
9.  Bridges KITE from Kite to Base Sepolia (if enabled).
10. Repeats for each account.
11. Restarts the daily cycle at a scheduled time.

## 📑 Notes

  * **⚠️ Security**: The `.env` file contains your private keys. Keep this file secure and private. Never share it or commit it to a public repository.
  * The new `safe-wallet.json` file is used to cache the balances of your multi-sig wallets. This makes the withdrawal process much faster on subsequent runs by skipping wallets that are already known to be empty.
  * Chat interactions are generated via Groq and saved in messages.txt.
  * A random user-agent is generated per account and saved in `session.json`.
